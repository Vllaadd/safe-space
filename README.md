# Safe Space

## Description

This application is a browser-based journal-entry app to promotes self-care because. Out of all the relationships we build during life, the most imporatant is the one that we have with ourselves. To love others, we must love ourselves first, which begins with an internal understanding on what we need on an individual basis. Through this application, we strive to make this difficult task somewhat more manageable by providing a safe, calming space to reflect on and process your thoughts for a deeper understanding of your personal needs.

## Instructions

Before you begin the process of self-expression, first focus on setting your environment. With this journal-entry-app, a user can type in a keyword, something that would put the user at-ease and make them feel calm. The user can then click the button to have the image displayed. As another option, the user can click the "Get Inspired" button to generate a random inspirational quote for further reflection or even a journaling topic. Finally, the user can determine to listen to a soothing playlist from the selection in the dropdown menu.

A message to the user: Start writing. Take it slow. Try to define and understand how you feel, why you feel that way, and write it all out. This is self therapy. It is more powerful and beneficial than you may think.
